Discussion of room culture

# This repository serves as a placeholder for discussion. Discussions are held in [this repo's issues](https://github.com/JavaScriptRoom/culture/issues)

## Room Ownership
[Changes to room ownership](https://github.com/JavaScriptRoom/culture/issues/1) shall be proposed via an issue on this repository. RO proposals will have 72 hours for voting, after which the proposal will be acted on if 50% or more of standing votes are in favour. Exceptions will be made for ROs that are clearly vandalizing or damaging the room, in which case they can have RO status removed immediately, to prevent further damage.

## Issue visibility

Issues that include voting are to [remain open for at least 72 hours](https://github.com/JavaScriptRoom/culture/issues/12) in order to give owners from different time zones the ability to read and address them.
