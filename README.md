## Room Ownership
[Changes to room ownership](https://github.com/JavaScriptRoom/culture/issues/1) shall be proposed via an issue on this repository. RO proposals will have 72 hours for voting, after which the proposal will be acted on if 50% or more of standing votes are in favour. Exceptions will be made for ROs that are clearly vandalizing or damaging the room, in which case they can have RO status removed immediately, to prevent further damage.
